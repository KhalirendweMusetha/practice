    <h2>Brief History of Lilian Ngoyi</h2>
    <p>Lilian Masediba Ngoyi was born in Pretoria in 1911 to a Bapedi family of six children. She initially did teacher training at the Kilnerton Training Institution. When her father could no longer afford the fees, she began training as a nurse at City Deep mine hospital. Ultimately, she took employment in a garment factory between 1945 and 1956, where she joined and became active in the Garment Workers Union, under the leadership of Solly Sachs.</p>
